# to access the printer in a web browser go to:
```http://kobramax.local/```

you well need to run a few things after the printer is setup. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19d5a3d8-8ee9-4dca-ba47-8e7f0f39f155)

attach the accelerator to the tool head with tape and plug it into the display USB.
make sure to have a long enough USB c to retch the far side of the x axis. 
make sure to have the USB C pointing to the display. 
open the printer.cfg under the machine tab
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b180ca8-3044-455c-bc81-998fa2d32d25)

remove the "#" from the [include BTT_LIS2DW_input_shaper.cfg] on line 18. then click "save and restart" in the top right.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3faacf76-2ec8-49af-97f8-7ec7e55490d7)

run the Input_Shaper_X command and wait for it to finish.

then move the accelerator to the bed with the USB C pointing to the display. 

run the Input_Shaper_Y command and wait for it to finish.

then click "save and restart" in the top right.

now that we have finished you can add the "#" back to [include BTT_LIS2DW_input_shaper.cfg] and remove the accelerator. 

then click "save and restart" in the top right.

thatâ€™s it you should be already to print.
